# Hanoi Tower Problem

- Uses the recursive function to solve the problem
- Saves the set of instructions in a .txt file
- User interactive to determine the number of disks and the name of the file

Troubleshooting: 
- The arrangement of int and str in each function. Mixed up the order in which the int and str should be.
- Making sure the user inputs are properly converted to their type attributes.
- Interchanging of source, goal, and spare in the recursive function to make sure the "goal" is spare and the "spare" is source, and so on.
